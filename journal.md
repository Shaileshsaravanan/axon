I'm quite not exactly a "pro" at CAD modeling only 3d printed project I've done so far is a rover with a friend, so well naturally I have started with making the simplest and basic parts needed for the printer from scratch using Fusion360 (and yt) and the frame will be made using 2040 V-slot aluminum similar to a Bear Upgrade.

Also I am either redesigning the parts from scratch or if im using smth that already exists I am still making it from scratch cuz I'm still learning CAD and I'm not exceptionally good at it. I will be using the [Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://www.printables.com/model/57217-i3-mk3s-printable-parts) as a reference for the parts and their dimensions. I am not going to use the Prusa i3 Mini Rambo and display stuff so naturally those stuff will not be included.

I am also planning to use Fullcontrol with Klipper firmware with a Raspberry Pi for the 4th axis control and support as Marlin doesn't natively support >3-axis control.

A Prusa i3 uses a Mini Rambo control board, however since I have an additional axis and an extra stepper motor for the 4th axis, I will be using a Duet3D Mini 5+ board for the printer as it allows for more motors to be controlled, and a Duet 3 Mini 2+ expansion board for an additional 2 stepper motor drivers. The boards are quite expensive ðŸ˜­ but welp needed for the 4-axis mod. I also plan on getting a Raspberry Pi with a Display and camera for octoprint but we'll see about that later, depending on my BOM.
